# Movie-classification-AI

Trying to use the subtitles of movies to predict their popularity and rating.

link for subtitles and (imdb) meta data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adiamaan/movie-subtitle-dataset?select=movies_meta.csv
link for rotten tomatoes data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset


The csvs were note uploaded to the GitHub repo because the dimension of some files is too large.
