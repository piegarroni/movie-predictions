      "being harassed by the government to take part\n",
      "in some entirely ridiculous war they seem quite unable to grasp\n",
      "is resulting in large numbers of people dying.\n",
      "so i'm now reduced to writing pamphlets for the no conscription fellowship,\n",
      "which may very possibly land me in prison.\n",
      "in other words: i'm obscure, decrepit, terrified, penniless, and fond of adjectives.\n",
      "surely it's not that bad.\n",
      "no. no, you're quite right.\n",
      "looked at another way, i'm a respectable elderly bugger of modest means.\n",

      "i prefer to think of myself as an educator, rather than as a...\n",
      "what?\n",
      "  as a pimp.   oh, now don't be silly.\n",
      "you know as well as i do it's a sickness with carrington.\n",
      "a girl of that age still a virgin. it's absurd.\n",
      "i was still a virgin at her age.\n",
      "but that's my whole point. don't you see? so was i.\n",

      "he got all breathy and the hairs in his nostrils became horribly agitated.\n",
      "finally, he said it was someone like me had driven his brother hugh to suicide.\n",
      "ah, semen.\n",
      "what is it about that ridiculous white secretion\n",
      "that pulls down the corners of an englishman's mouth?\n",
      "you see, i'm not against it in theory. it's just the thought of mark, somehow.\n",
      "well, i can't, of course, agree with you, but... there we are.\n",

      "i love being with you.\n",
      "you're so cold and wise.\n",
